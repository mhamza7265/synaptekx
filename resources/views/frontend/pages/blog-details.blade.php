            <p class="mt-4">Artificial intelligence is no longer a futuristic concept—it is actively transforming industries, and banking is no exception. From enhancing operational efficiency to redefining customer engagement, AI’s role in banking continues to expand. With the advent of generative AI, banks are now leveraging advanced capabilities to drive innovation, optimize costs, and create personalized financial experiences. <br>
                According to McKinsey’s 2023 banking report, generative AI alone could enhance productivity in the banking sector by up to 5% and reduce global expenditures by as much as $300 billion. This marks a significant shift from traditional data-driven AI applications to more sophisticated, predictive, and generative capabilities that are reshaping the entire banking landscape.</p>

            <p class="mt-4">AI’s journey in banking began with automation and data analytics. Early implementations focused on risk assessment, fraud detection, and operational efficiencies. However, AI has since evolved into an indispensable tool for strategic decision-making and customer-centric innovations.<br><br> Today, traditional banks and neobanks alike are harnessing AI to go beyond back-office optimizations and deliver hyper-personalized experiences to their customers. The shift towards AI-driven banking enables institutions to combine security, efficiency, and customer engagement in ways that were previously unimaginable.</p>
            <h5 class="fs-32 mt-5">Banking that understands you</h5>
            <p class="mt-4">Customer experience is at the core of AI’s impact in banking. AI-powered tools such as chatbots, predictive analytics, and personalized financial advisory systems are revolutionizing the way banks interact with their clients.<br><br> AI-driven chatbots, such as Bank of America’s Erica, have demonstrated remarkable success in customer service. Since its launch in 2018, Erica has handled over 1.5 billion interactions, providing real-time responses to queries, assisting with transactions, and significantly reducing wait times. These AI-driven interactions build trust and improve overall satisfaction by offering instant, 24/7 support.</p>
            <h5 class="fs-32 mt-5">Smarter fraud prevention with AI</h5>
            <p class="mt-4">AI’s ability to analyze customer data and predict financial behavior has ushered in a new era of personalized banking. By leveraging machine learning, banks can tailor products, services, and investment advice to meet individual customer needs.<br><br> Bank of America’s Glass, an AI-powered research and analytics platform, exemplifies how AI is enhancing customer engagement. By analyzing market data and user behavior, Glass predicts client needs and provides personalized investment recommendations, positioning the bank as an industry leader in AI-driven financial advisory services.</p>
